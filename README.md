## Functionality of the app
This is a score counter app. You can choose the two teams (out of the 32 teams of the NFL) at the top of the screen. Below that the scores are displayed. The scores can be updated according to the progress of the game. Five buttons are implemented per team for score updating (touchdown, fieldgoal, safety, point-after-touchdown (PAT), 2-point-conversion). Note that the PAT and 2-point-conversion button require the pressing of the touchdown button first. If touchdown was not pressed and toast appears reminding the user to do so. At the buttom a reset-button is integrated in order to set the scores and teams to the respective start values.
