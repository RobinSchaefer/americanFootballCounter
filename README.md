# americanFootballCounter (NFL Score Counter)
An Android app that can be used to count the scores during a match of American Football. The app is part of the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship in collaboration with Udacity. 

## Content of the repo
The repo contains the following files:

* MainActivity.java
* activity_main.xml
* colors.xml
* string.xml
* styles.xml

These files contain the actual code that was written for the project. This is intended as a survey of the skills that were acquired during the course so far. 

## Functionality of the app
This is a score counter app. You can choose the two teams (out of the 32 teams of the NFL) at the top of the screen. Below that the scores are displayed. The scores can be updated according to the progress of the game. Five buttons are implemented per team for score updating (touchdown, fieldgoal, safety, point-after-touchdown (PAT), 2-point-conversion). At the buttom a reset-button is integrated in order to set the scores and teams to the respective start values.
